## [2.2.1-alpha] - 2025-11-24

### Added

- **ECC Property Value Encryption**: Optional `publicEncryptionKey` parameter on SDK initialization enables zero-knowledge encryption of property values in dev/staging environments using ECIES (Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme). Avo never has access to the private key, ensuring complete data privacy.
  - Uses secp256k1 curve with AES-256-GCM for hybrid encryption
  - Only encrypts in dev/staging environments (production sends schema only)
  - Adds optional `encryptedPropertyValue` field to event schema
  - CLI tool for key generation: `npx avo-inspector generate-keys`
  - Note: Key generation and decryption are not exported from SDK (use CLI tool for keys, decryption happens in Avo's dashboard)

- **EventSpec Fetching**: Automatically fetches and caches event specifications from Avo API in dev/staging environments
  - Non-blocking async API calls
  - In-memory caching for performance
  - NOT called in production (prod remains simple and fast)
  - Foundation for Phase 2: event validation

### Changed

- Production environment now optimized: no property values, no encryption, no EventSpec API calls
- Dev/Staging environments now support rich debugging with encrypted values and event specs

### Dependencies

- Added `eciesjs` ^0.4.11 for ECC/ECIES encryption

## 2.2.0

- Add anonymous ID support to track events without user identification

## 2.1.0

- Add `set networkTimeout` setter, in ms
- Improve timeout errors handling

## 2.0.0

- Contains no changes for most users
- [Breaking] Upgrades Reason bindings to Rescript. This is a breaking change for users who are using bs-platform as that's no longer supported. The bindings now support Rescript 9.1, 10, 11 and later. The interface has changed slightly with lowercase `env` variants and dropping the unit at the end of the constructor.

## 1.4.2

Security update

## 1.4.1

Security update

## 1.3.0

Multiple Avo Inspector instances support, with the optional `suffix` constructor parameter
