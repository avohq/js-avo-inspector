## [2.2.1-alpha] - 2025-11-24

### Added

- **RSA Property Value Encryption**: Optional `publicKey` parameter on SDK initialization enables zero-knowledge encryption of property values in dev/staging environments. Avo never has access to the private key, ensuring complete data privacy.
  - Only encrypts in dev/staging environments (production sends schema only)
  - Adds optional `encryptedPropertyValue` field to event schema
  - CLI tool for key generation: `npx avo-inspector generate-keys`
  - Note: Key generation and decryption are not exported from SDK (use CLI tool for keys, decryption happens in Avo's dashboard)

- **EventSpec Fetching**: Automatically fetches and caches event specifications from Avo API in dev/staging environments
  - Non-blocking async API calls
  - In-memory caching for performance
  - NOT called in production (prod remains simple and fast)
  - Foundation for Phase 2: event validation

### Changed

- Production environment now optimized: no property values, no encryption, no EventSpec API calls
- Dev/Staging environments now support rich debugging with encrypted values and event specs

### Dependencies

- Added `jsencrypt` ^3.3.2 for RSA encryption
